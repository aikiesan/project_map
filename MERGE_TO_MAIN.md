## Current Status

✅ **Test suite and reports have been created on branch:** `claude/run-platform-tests-011CUfRMM1Dcbpp3SXjBsXQq`

✅ **Files ready for main branch:**

- `tests/` directory with 56 unit tests (1,143 lines of test code)

## To Merge to Main Branch

### Option 1: Manual Merge (Recommended)

Since the main branch has protection rules, you'll need to manually merge or create a PR:

```bash
# From your local machine
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge claude/run-platform-tests-011CUfRMM1Dcbpp3SXjBsXQq
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Create Pull Request via GitHub

1. Go to: https://github.com/aikiesan/project_map
2. You should see a prompt to create a PR for the recent branch push
3. Or manually create a PR from `claude/run-platform-tests-011CUfRMM1Dcbpp3SXjBsXQq` to `main`
4. Review and merge the PR

### Option 3: Direct File Copy

If you just need the files on main without full git history:

```bash
git checkout main
git checkout claude/run-platform-tests-011CUfRMM1Dcbpp3SXjBsXQq -- TESTING_REPORT.md TEST_SUMMARY.md tests/
git commit -m "Add testing suite and validation reports"
git push origin main
```

## What's Included

- **Comprehensive Testing Report** (TESTING_REPORT.md)
  - Platform score: 85/100 - Publication Ready
  - Complete code quality metrics
  - Security audit results
  - Test methodology validation

- **Quick Reference** (TEST_SUMMARY.md)

## Branch Protection Note

The main branch has push protection (403 error), which is a good security practice. 
This prevents accidental direct commits to main and ensures all changes go through review.
